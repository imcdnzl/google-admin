This is a simple script at the moment to work with email templates on Google Apps.

It might grow to something more.

Documentation will be added as time permits but the best documentation
at present is at:
http://blog.cloudreach.co.uk/2012/09/setting-domain-wide-signatures-for.html

The documentation doesn't mention the new function Ian added - getAllUsers,
this creates a sheet which checks if everybody is in main sheet or not.
